    <h1><b>Entry One </b></h1>
    
    <p> Today was the first class and I learned about Adobe Photoshop, and I completely sucked at it. Tomorrow hopefully I will do better, but i severly doubt it.</p>
    

<h2> <b>Entry Two </b></h2>

        <p>I SUCK!! the claass is interesting but to be honest I have no patience or talent for this. Photoshop and Animation is hard!!! </p>
        
        <h3> Final Entry </h3>
<p>So, I am clearly not used to this journaling  thing a whole semester has passed me by and now im doing the final project. This semester was absoluteky the hardest, feeling like I walked into a trap with this semsester i tried my hardest to show up to every class and give my undevided attention to all of them.  </p>
