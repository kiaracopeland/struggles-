   <h2>INTRODUCTION....</h2> 
        
    <p>Welcome to the home page of the <em>"World's OK-est Project".</em> Here an HTML page will be created, hopefully this will go well enough to show what was taught in class was actually retained. </p>
        
        <p> This is not going to be a website, but more of a <b><em>blog</em></b>. the daily telling/complaining (more like a rapid quick fire of words and scatterd memories) of what happened during the second semester January-May.  </p>
